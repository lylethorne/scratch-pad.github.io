/**
 * 
 * DATA TYPES
 * 
 * 0. Data types are a specific value type that the program needs to distinguish from one another. 
 * They are built in and in order for the program to run, it needs to know what it is operating on
 * and if it is a simple or complex data type.
 * 
 * 1. Number represents numerical data, such as 1, 3.14159, etc...
 * 
 * 2. Strings are used to represent sentences or words and is represented by that text wrapped 
 * around quotes or backticks ('', "", ``)
 * 
 * 3. Boolean is the term used to represent a value that will either be true or false
 * 
 * 4. Array is a comlex data type that can hold an infinit amount of data. Arrays are thought of
 * as lists where there isnt a relation to the data it holds or the order. Arrays can hold any type
 * of data including simple and complex. It is represented by square brackets holding the elements 
 * seperated by a comma [ x, y]
 * 
 * 5. Object is also a complex data type, however it speficially refers to a person/object and the 
 * data that it holds. Objects have properties inside them that are represented by a key and it's value
 * pair. An object is represented by the curly brackets { } with the key value pairs separated by a colon
 * and ending with a comma. 
 * 
 * 6. Functions perform actions on a value it is given.
 * 
 * 7. When a variable is not assigned a value, it is undefined and the type is undefined. 
 * 
 * 8. Null represents the intentional absence of a value. 
 * 
 * 9. NaN stands for Not a Number. It is generally encountered when a mathmatical problem 
 * does not resolve to a number.
 * 
 * 10. Infinity and - infinity are properties of the global object, so they can be accessed from anywhere.
 * Infinity is different then the numeric idea of infinity. Here, it represents a value that is greater than
 * any other number (in JavaScript it is when a number reaches 1.797693134862315E+308). And the inverse is
 * true for -infinity.
 * 
 * 11. Simple data types are strings, numbers, booleans, null, and undefined. They represent an immutable value, 
 * and do not have an action. While complex data types are arrays, objects, and functions. Complex data types are
 * hold series of data and can perform actions on the data they hold.
 * 
 * 12. Primitive values are copied by value, while complex are copied by reference. 
 * what does that mean and how are they different?
