///YOU NEED A CODED EXAMPLE FOR EVERY SINGLE TYPE OF OPERATOR EXCEPT UNARY
/**
 * OPERATOR
 * 
 * 0. An Operator is a type of syntax that consists of alphabetical characters, punctuation, and integers.
 * These characters are reserved in the program because they have a built in functionality.
 * 
 * 1. Assignment operators are used when variables are being assigned '=' to data. They can also be
 * used to manipulate the data by addition '+=' and subtraction '-='.
 * 
 * 2. Arithmetic operators allow math to perform in code. There is add '+', subtract '-', 
 * division '/', mulitiplication '*', exponentiation '**', remainder '%', increment '++', 
 * and decrement '--'. These can be performed on numbers, variables, and expressions. And,
 * just as within mathmatics - when multiple arithmetic operators are present, operator 
 * precedence takes place (multiplication is done before addition, etc...).
 * 
 * 3. Comparison operators are used to determine equity or diference in logical statements.
 * Generally the result of using one of these will result in a true or false value.
 * There is equal to '==', equal value and type '===', not equal to '!=', not equal to value
 * nor type '!==', greater than '>', less than '<', equal or greather than '>=', equal or 
 * less than '<='.
 * 
 * 4. Logical operators are used to determine the logic betwen variables or values. There is
 * and '&&', or '||', not '!'. The first two are used when there are multiple conditions that must
 * be true or false in order for that next piece of code to run.
 * 
 * 5. Unary operators
 * 
 * 6. Ternary operators
