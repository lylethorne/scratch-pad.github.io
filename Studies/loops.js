 * 0. Loops are built in constructs in JavaScript. They allow for a block of code to be 
 * repeated as many times as needed. Loops also iterate over collections of data and allow
 * programers to access the individual values held.
 * 
 * 1. There are three diferent main loops that are used, they are for/ for in/ and while loops
 * For loops are a counting mechanism that give us a starting point, end point, and the 
 * frequency in which to repeat. For-in loops are used to access the keys and values of an
 * object. A while loop is used as long a condition is true is true or false, it will execute
 * the code 
 * 
 * 
 * 2. Loops can count forward any number or pattern, or backwards to 0.
 * 
 * 3. Loop over array forwards or backwards
 * 
 * 4. Loop over an object
