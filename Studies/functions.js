/**
 * function bb
 * 
 * function is a block of code that gets reused - keeping it dry and cute. 
 * 
 * Functions are made up of a name, parameters aka arguments, the function body,
 * and sometimes but not always a return statement. A function can be defined AND called 
 * - but the two are not the same! 
 * 
 * functions can be created by defining or expressing
 * 
 * //define
 * function name(parameter){
 *  body
 *  body
 *  maybe a return
 * }
 * 
 * A function Expression is when a variable's value is a function
 * 
 * var x = function name(parameter){ body }
 * 
 * 
 * //call
 * name(parameter);
 * 
 * Functions are treated as first-class objects in Javascript! 
 * First-class objects can be a parameter for a function, returned by a function,
 * and even stored as a variable (but you already know that, because you've read expressions), 
 * but also inside arrays and objects!
 * 
 * When a function is used as a function's parameter - it is a 'callback'.
